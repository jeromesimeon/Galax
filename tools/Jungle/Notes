Important notes
-----------------

* Library Changes
 ----------------
    
    Make sure that the libdb.so you are using points to the same version that 
    you compiled against. To check, use ldd galax-run, then ls -l the
    resulting libdb.so library. It should be in your berkeley
    installation - not the default with fedora.

* DB_NOTFOUND
  DB_NOTFOUND (in db.h) is the only constant we rely on. Unfortunately it
  changed between versions 4.1 -> 4.3. You can change which constant is used 
  in the top of jungle.ml.

* String Manipulation * We do not use strings any longer. *
  --------------------
	String in ocaml *not* '\0' terminated 		(language feature)
	String in C '\0' terminated 				(language feature)
	String in BerkeleyDB *not* '\0' terminated 	(design decision)

	String Conversions  C <==> Ocaml
		+ use proper macros and routines and those will handle the
		  placement and removal of '\0' in the end of a string.

	String Conversions C <==> BDB
		+ Do not store '\0' in BDB (use strlen()).
		+ Append '\0' to string after retrieval from BDB.
