urgent
=======
- fix namespaces in xquery2soap generated stub! 
- fix xs(d):anyType --> complex type instead of [..?]
- test type mapping for all cases

- xquery2soap should use "import module" for the original module
  and it should probably include the code currently generated by
  "galax-mapwsdl -server"

- "galax-mapwsdl -server" might needs some fixes: stop generating the "return" wrapper element
- check the syntax of "import service" and "xquery2soap"


export
======
- implement WSDL generation
- capability to export a chosen binding

extra
=====
- schema import
- module import
- use correctly the namespace attribute of an operation
- SOAP headers etc
