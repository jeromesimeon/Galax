[Note: Mary recommends this following installation process!]

These installation instructions are for Galax developers who want to
use GODI to install the O'Caml compiler and all libraries on which
Galax depends and who are working on a development copy of Galax
source code.

I.  Installing GODI and GODI-Galax package 

  [Warning: Installing packages using GODI is an ON-LINE process, so
   preferably, you should be connected to the Net by a fast hard-wire
   connection.]

  1. Download GODI from : http://godi.ocaml-programming.de/

     1a. Follow GODI installation instructions through
         "bootstrap_stage2" command, adding GODI bin/sbin directories
         to your PATH as instructed.

         [Note: As an O'Caml user, you will find all the O'Caml
          executables in <your-godi-directory>/bin and the O'Caml
          libraries in <your-godi-directory>/lib/ocaml.]

  2. Run godi_console 

     2a. Select godi-galax package (#83)

     2b. Select [b]uild & install, then e[x]it

         This will add all of Galax's dependencies to your GODI configuration.

     2c. GODI will give you Galax's configure options:

		[ 1] GODI_GALAX_INCLUDE_JUNGLE = no
		[ 2]  GODI_GALAX_INCLUDE_C_API = no
		[ 3] GODI_GALAX_INCLUDE_JAVA_$ = no
		[ 4]   GODI_GALAX_INCLUDE_UTF8 = yes
		[ 5] GODI_GALAX_INCLUDE_ISO88$ = yes
		[ 6]      GODI_GALAX_JAVA_HOME = unset
		[ 7]       GODI_GALAX_JAVA_BIN = unset
		[ 8]   GODI_GALAX_JAVA_INCLUDE = unset
		[ 9] GODI_GALAX_REGRESSION_SU$ = unset

         Select e[xi]t.

         [Note: You do not need to make any changes here, because we are
         installing the GODI-Galax package just for bootstrapping
         purposes. ]

     2d. Select [s]tart/continue, which will report all dependencies.

         Then select [s]tart/continue, which will report actual
         dependencies based on your current GODI installation.

         Then select [o]k.

   3. Take a long coffee break...while GODI downloads and installs
      packages. 

      [Note: As a Galax user, you can find the Galax command-line
       tools in <your-godi-directory>/bin and the Galax examples and
       usecases in <your-godi-directory>/godi/share.]

II. Installing Galax source 

   1. Checkout Galax from cvs-graphviz.research.att.com:/cvsroot.

      cvs checkout galax 

   2. Configure Galax.

      In galax/ run: 

        ./configure -ocaml-home <your-godi-directory>

      If you want any of the APIs, add options -with-c, -with-java, etc. 

      Run "./configure -help" for all configuration options. 

   3. Build Galax.

      In galax/ run: 
  
        make world
