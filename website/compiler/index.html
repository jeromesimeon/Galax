        <h1>The Galax Compiler</h1>

        <p>The purpose of this page is to document our progress in
        developing the Galax XQuery compiler. It includes an overview
        of its internal architecture, intermediate compilation stages,
        and some material on XQuery optimization.</p>

        <p>Some of the main features of the compiler are:
           <ul>
              <li>A fully documented compilation scheme. Most of the
              compilation is formally specified as a means to provide
              specific correctness guarantees.<li>
              <li>State of the art optimization layers, including
              type-based rewriting, unused code elimination, join
              optimization, query decorrelation techniques.<li>
              <li>An hybrid physical later, that gives the ability to
              process XML streams as well as XML trees in memory.</li>
              <li>Experimental optimization techniques for XQuery
              updates, XQuery scripting, and distributed XQuery.</li>
           </ul>
        </p>

        <p>The compiler is fully stable, and passes the majority of
        the W3C XQuery test suite (version 1.0.2). Some of the
        optimization techniques described here are at various level of
        maturity. As a result, some of them are disabled by default in
        the main Galax public release.</p>

        <hr/>

    	<h1><a name="overview"></a>Overview and Architecture</h1>

        <p>The Galax compiler internally uses two intermediate
        languages:
            <ul>
               <li>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-semantics/"
               class="title">XQuery Core</a> is defined as part of the
               set of XQuery specifications and used during the
               earlier compilation stages. It exposes the details of
               XQuery's semantics, in a way suitable for applying
               cleanup rewrites, and to prepare for heavier-duty
               optimization.</li>
               <li>The <a href="#algebra" class="title">Galax
               Algebra</a> is an extension of classic
               nested-relational algebras with suitable XML operators,
               and is used during the later compilation stages.
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The following figure shows the compiler architecture.</p>

               vspace="5">
        </center>

        <p>The rest of this page provides details about each
        compilation phase, as well as pointers to relevant
        documents.</p>

    <hr/>

    <h1><a name="parsing"></a>Parsing</h1>

    <p>Galax follows a fairly traditional parsing, with XQuery
    grammar's implemented using Yacc, along with special purpose
    lexers in Lex. Some aspects of parsing in XQuery are known to be
    challenging, notably due to the presence of several lexical
    states. The output of the parser is a classic abstract syntax tree
    (AST), whose node correspond to the different kinds of expressions
    allowed by the XQuery grammar.</p>

    <p>The full XQuery grammar in BNF can be found in
    the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery/#nt-bnf">XQuery 1.0
    specification</a>. More details about issues related to XQuery
    lexing can be found in
    the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-xpath-parsing/">tokenizer
    note</a> both published by the W3C.</p>

    <hr/>

    <h1><a name="normalization"></a>Normalization</h1>

    <p>Normalization is applied to the AST produced by the parser to
    produce a new AST with the following properties.</p>
    <ul>
       <li>It only uses a small subset of XQuery known as
       the <emph>XQuery Core</emph>. Reliance on a smaller subset
       facilitates the development of subsequent rewritings, and
       ensure their most general application.</li>
       <li>Every operation is explicit, making sure a full account for
       XQuery's semantics is available (i.e., with no implicit
       operations, or syntactic sugar).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Normalization is fully specified as part of
    the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-semantics/">XQuery Formal
    Semantics</a>, which is part of the set of published W3C XQuery
    documents.</p>

    <p>Galax implements normalization exactly as specified, but to the
    following important exception that iterators (FLWOR expressions,
    quantified expressions), are not broken down to individual for,
    let, conditional expressions, for each clause. This departure from
    the official specification is key to prepare
    for <a href="#compilation" class="title">algebraic
    compilation</a>.</p>

    <hr/>

    <h1><a name="rewriting"></a>Rewritings</h1>

    <center>
      <img src="archi_rewriting.gif"

           hspace="4"
           vspace="5">
    </center>

    <p>Before applying optimization techniques, a number of actual
    transformation on the query are performed. Some of those query
    transformations have a direct impact on performances, or enable
    the consistent use of optimizations during later compilation
    stages. Examples of such transformations include: removing
    implicit casting of nodes to values or removing sorting by
    document order.</p>

<!--
    <p>More detailed about that phase and on its impact can be found
    in the following papers.</p>

    <h1><a name="compilation"></a>Compilation</h1>

    <p>Once the AST has been cleaned up, through rewriting, we compile
    the corresponding query into an algebraic form. The algebra being
    used in based on a traditional NRA (Nested-Relational Algebra)
    extended to support XML operations.</p>

           hspace="4"
           vspace="5">
    </center>

    <p>Once in algebraic form, the query plan is rewritten to obtain a
    more efficient evaluation strategy. This notably includes key join
    and query decorrelation rewritings.</p>

    <p>Complete rules for compiling the XQuery core into that algebra
    are descibed in the following paper.</p>

    <p>Galax includes specific algorithms for certain classes of
    operations which are expensive or used very often during XQuery
    processing. Note that efficient support for those operations
    typically assumes specific knowledge about the <a href="#physical"
    class="title">physical representation</a>.</p>

    <h2><a name="projection"></a>XML Projection</h2>

    <p>One of the bottleneck of query processing for main-memory
    XQuery implementations is due to the size of tree representations
    for XML document (e.g., DOM or the XQuery Data Model). XML
    projection is physical operation that can be used to remove
    uncessary node in the XML data model based on the paths used in a
    given query. Document projection takes an XML stream as input and
    loads a projected document according to a set of input path
    expressions. Those paths are inferred from the query using a
    static analysis algorithm described in details in the following
    papers.</p>

    <h2><a name="treepatterns"></a>Tree Patterns</h2>

    <p>Another important operation which is widely used in XQuery is
    navigation, in the form of XPath expressions. Specific algorithms
    have been developed for certain fragment of XPath known
    as <emph>Tree Patterns</emph>. In some cases those algorithms have
    been proven to be optimal. Galax includes specific rewritings to
    detect such tree patterns when possible, hence enabling the use of
    such efficient algorithms.</p>

    <p>How tree patterns operators are introduced in query plans, and
    limited optimality of the corresponding detections, are described
    in the following papers.</p>

    <p>XML is a very versatile markup language, suitable for many
    kinds of applications in many kinds of environment. Galax has the
    ambition to be a very versatile XQuery implementation that will
    work on a variety of physical XML representations. We are
    especially interested in experimenting with Galax in the following
    environments.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>XML Files.</b> Many applications just deal with ordinary
      XML files. Files are easy to write and maintaing using many
      ordinary XML tools and work well for light-weight
      applications.</li>
      <li><b>XML Streams.</b> In the context of distributed
      applications, such as for information integration or Web
      services, XML documents are accessed as streams from the
      network.</li>
      <li><b>Native XML repository.</b> Data-intensive applications
      dealing with large amounts of XML data often require the use of
      a storage manager. The use of an XML storage manager can provide
      important benefit to your application, including scalability,
      performances, concurrency control, crash recovery, and
      high-availability.</li>
 </ul>

<!--
    <p>Currently, Galax only supports access to local XML files, but
    we are working on hooking up an http/SOAP client inside Galax that
    will allow Galax to receive XML streams from the network. We are
    also considering the development of a storage manager that will
    allow Galax users to process efficiently large amounts of XML
    data. Please come back to check on our progress!</p>
