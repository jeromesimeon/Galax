<h1>Welcome to the Galax live demo!</h1>

<p>The Demo system is running Galax 0.6.5.</p>

<p>The menu on the left lists various XQuery use cases that you can
execute using Galax.  Most of the use cases are those from the <a
href="http://www.w3c.org/TR/xmlquery-use-cases">XQuery 1.0 Use Cases
Working Draft</a>.</p>

<p>Each use case includes several sample queries and input documents
that you can execute using Galax.  The result of evaluating a query
includes the static type that Galax inferred for the input query and
the query result computed by Galax.</p>

<p>You can modify the sample queries or write your own query in the
<b>Query text</b> box.</p>

<p>At the bottom of each use case you will find some configuration
parameters. You can turn <b>Typing</b> or <b>Evaluation</b> off. You
can also <b>print the normalized query</b> (in the XQuery core). You
can also have Galax emit debugging messages during typing or
evaluation by checking the <b>Debugging</b> button.</p>
