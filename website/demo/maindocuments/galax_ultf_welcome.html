<h1>Welcome to the Galax Update Facility live demo!</h1>

<p>The Demo system is running Galax 0.6.6.</p>

<p>The menu on the left lists various XQuery Update Facility use cases
that you can execute using Galax.  Most of the use cases are those
from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xqupdateusecases/">XQuery
Update Facility Use Cases</a>.</p>

<p>Each use case includes several sample updates and input documents
that you can execute using Galax.</p>

<p>You can modify the sample update or write your own update in the
<b>Update text</b> box.</p>

<p>At the bottom of each use case you will find some configuration
parameters. You can turn <b>Evaluation</b> off. You can also <b>print
the normalized update</b>. You can also have Galax emit debugging
messages during typing or evaluation by checking the <b>Debugging</b>
button.</p>
