*** Galax Release: 0.4.0
*** August 2003

This directory contains the current use case examples that have been
tested with Galax.

I. Running Usecases
===================

In ${GALAXHOME}/usecases, execute

  make 

to run all the use cases.  Their output is written to into
{use-case-name}_usecase.xml.

Each usecase consists of a "context" file (globally defined variables
and types) and a file containing all the queries.  To run by hand,
execute:

  ${GALAXHOME}/bin/galax-run -context {use-case-name}_context.xq {use-case-name}_usecase.xq

II. Generating Web site
=======================

The files in this directory are used to automatically generate the
demo. In order for the generation to work, these file must follow a
precise organization and syntax.

- Each separate use case must be registered in the Usecases file with
  one filename (with it's title separated with a '$' sign) per line
  and no whitespace.
 
- Assuming 'name' is the name of the usecase in the Usecases file,
  there must be three distinct files in the directory:

  'name_documents.txt' must contain the list of all the XML input
  documents with a description of what is in that documents, separated
  by a '$' sign.

  'name_context.xq' must contain the input context for all the queries
  in the use case: type declarations, function definitions and global
  variables.

  'name.xq' must contain all the queries and follow the following
  format precisely:

	 (: QXX:  SHORT DESCRIPTION :)
	 (: QXX:  LONG DESCRIPTION :)

	 Query;

	 (: QYY: ...

  Comments are used to generate the HTML forms (small description) and
  the english version of the query. There cannot be any additional
  comments in that file.

  The last query *must not* be followed by a ';' sign.
