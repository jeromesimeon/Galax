This directory implements the Narada mesh protocol in DXQ.

To simulate a five-node network:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Run:  make run

which creates the directory run/ that contains the DXQ programs for
the five nodes, n1 to n5.

Run galaxd on this directory in simulation mode with:

    galaxd -language xqueryp -s run

To run on the Arizona cluster inside AT&T Labs:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Run:  make cluster

which creates the directory cluster/ that contains the DXQ programs for
the cactus nodes. 

Startup an xterm on each cactus node:

    multixterm -xf cluster.tcl 

Then in main multixterm window, type:
    cd <GALAX>/examples/dxq/narada
    <GALAX>/galaxd -language xqueryp -d cluster -t cluster-latencies.xml

The latencies.xml file contains the TOPOLOGY.  Don't forget it!

On some other machine (e.g., scottsdale): 
    cd ~/narada-movie
    <GALAX>/webgui -d <GALAX>/examples/dxq/narada/cluster -drop true -log true

With the "-drop true" option, the webgui filters out the inter-node
messages and does not display them on the Web page, so only
state-change messages are actually displayed.  The WebGUI caches all
messages for playback in the HTML interface, so "-drop true" is
necessary for this example, otherwise WebGUI dies because it can't
allocate memory.

The "-log true" option logs every message (inter-node and state
changes) to log files in the directory $TMPDIR/webgui-<processid>.
The weblog.log file can be replayed by Trevor's animation program,
tracegui.swf.

In the Web browser, submit the following expressions:

  N:init() to ALL
  N:go()   to ALL

For testing purposes, e.g., see if things parse correctly, you might
want to try:

    cd run
    galax-run -language xqueryp -dynamic off n1.xq

Since the run directory is generated automatically you might want to
remove it after you are done with:

    make clean
