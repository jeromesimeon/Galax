This is a distributed directory service written in Xquery with the
fn:doc("dxq://host") extension.

Each host exports a directory through the local:main() function.
A directory is a set of entries mapping names to hosts, e.g., 

     <dir>  
     <entry name="Bob" value="b"/>
     <entry name="Claire" value="c"/>
     </dir>;

maps Bob to the host b and Claire to the host c.

Typically a host's directory is defined by some local entries
(variable $dbase) and a full directory that incorporates the local
entries and some remote entries (variable $dfull).  $dfull is defined
using fn:doc("dxq://remotehost").
