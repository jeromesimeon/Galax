To run server, in examples/dxq/test, run:

   galaxd -s .

This will start three servers:

     galaxd: starting server for a on port 3000
     galaxd: starting server for b on port 3001
     galaxd: starting server for pathserver on port 3002

To run regression tests, in examples/dxq/test/client, run:

     galax-run test.xq

Results should all be "true()" with exception of last example, which
should (intentionally) throw an error.
