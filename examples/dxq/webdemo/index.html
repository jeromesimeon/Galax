<h2>Goals</h2>

The goal of the DXQ project is to support development of reliable,
extensible, and efficient distributed resource-management
protocols. Our strategy to meet these requirements is to provide a
high-level, distributed, and optimizable <b>query language</b> for
implementing distributed <b>resource-management protocols</b>. By using a
high-level language, a protocol's semantics is transparent, not
hidden, in the implementation, which supports the reliability
requirement. In addition, the implementation is optimizable by general
query optimization techniques. Automating optimization supports the
efficiency requirement and permits implementors to focus more on
functionality and less on performance.

<h2>The Language</h2>

The DXQ language includes all XQueryP, a procedural language based on
XQuery 1.0 with <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-xqupdate-20060711/">update</a>
statements, to which it addds a few extensions.  Unlike XQuery, DXQ
distinguishes a module's interface from its implementation. Module
interfaces contain only declarations of functions and variables that
are exported.  A client query may remotely call functions in a module
exported by a DXQ server, to which it can refer by using an <span
class="keyword">import interface</span> statement.  DXQ also adds a
<span class="keyword">let server implement</span> expression, which
dynamically asserts that a DXQ server at a particular URI implements
an imported interface.

The expression language is also enriched with two remote evaluation
expressions, <span class="keyword">from server return</span> and <span
class="keyword">at server do</span>, which redirect evaluation of an
expression to a DXQ server synchronously and asynchronously,
respectively.  The following grammar gives the syntax for these
extensions.

<pre>
      Interface ::= <span class="keyword">interface</span> namespace NCName = URILiteral; InterfaceProlog;
         Module ::= module namespace NCName = URILiteral (<span class="keyword">implements</span> URILiteral)?; ModuleProlog
InterfaceImport ::= <span class="keyword">import interface namespace</span> NCName = URILiteral
           Expr ::= ... (: XQueryP :)
                |  <span class="keyword">let server</span> NCName <span class="keyword">implement</span> NCName <span class="keyword">at</span> Expr return Expr
                |  <span class="keyword">from server</span> NCName <span class="keyword">return</span> Expr
                |  <span class="keyword">at server</span> NCName <span class="keyword">do</span> Expr  
</pre>

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<img src="images/galaxd-process1.jpg" alt="DXQ" />

<p>

DXQ is implemented in the <a
href="http://www.galaxquery.net">Galax</a> XQuery architecture, which
compiles XQuery programs into an algebraic representation (a query
plan) that is exchanged by DXQ servers.  This plan is enclosed into a
remote closure which allows to ship an arbitrary expression and
encapsulates whatever context is necessary to evaluate the expression
remotely. Galax's hybrid algebra includes XML "tree" operators and
classic tuple operators.  The latter permit efficient implementation
(the Optimizer stage) of common query idioms like join an group-by,
which are expressed by nested FLWOR expressions in XQuery. The
optimized plan is evaluated based on the code selection performed on
the server.

</p>

<p>

The extension relies on a simple client-server protocol based on HTTP
that permits the communication between DXQ peers.

</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

DXQ can be downloaded with the last <a
href="http://www.galaxquery.net">Galax</a> distribution and is 
available as a server application, <em>galaxd</em>.

<p>
galaxd reads the programs of the DXQ servers from DXQ source files.
It can either create a network with nodes on different machines, or
simulate one on localhost, based on the programs from a given
directory.  For the full option list, try `galaxd -help'. For the
purpose of this demo, we'll show a local simulation, which can be run
by going into the directory containing the distributed application and
typing:
</p>
<p>
<code>$ galaxd -language xquerybang -dxq on -s .</code>

</p>

<h2>DNS Examples</h2>

<p>
The main example we focused on, in the beginning, is a distributed DNS
application. The DNS network is formed by servers and resolvers, each
running its own program. We focused on the core functionality of DNS. 
The complete description of the protocol and its features is
detailed in <a href='http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1034.txt'>RFC1034</a>
and  <a href='http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt'>RFC1035</a>.
</p>
<p>

In order to separate the common interface exported by the peers in a
DXQ network from the implementation, we needed to extend the XQuery
module system with the notion of interface.  For instance, all our DNS
servers implement export the interface below:

<pre>
interface namespace Server = "http://www.dns.org/Server";

declare function Server:RR() external;
declare function Server:down($hostname as xs:string) external;

</pre>

<ul>

<li> The <code>RR()</code> function returns the <a
href='http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1034.txt'>resource records</a> 
of that server. It is typically called by a DNS resolver which
interrogates servers.
</li>

<li> The <code>down()</code> function tries to resolve a URL both by using the
addresses locally stored and by calling other <a
href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt">authoritative</a> servers
specified in its resource records. It is used in a peer-to-peer 
scenario, when the servers are willing to perform recursive resolution.
</li>

</ul>

</p>

<ol>
<li> <b>Naive Iterative DNS Resolution</b> <br/>
<!-- R:lookup("192.128.133.77", "www.research.att.com") -->
See the <a href='examples/lookupdxqoff/1.html' target='_blank'>demo</a>
and the <a href='examples/lookupdxqoff/anim.gif' target='_blank'>animated version</a>.

<p>
The lookup function takes as argument the address of the first server
to be asked and the hostname whose address are looking for. It starts
by retrieving the addresses stored on the server and continues,
recursively, by sending requests to other servers to which it is
referred.

<pre>
import interface Server = "http://www.dns.org/Server";
import module U = "DNSUtility"; 
declare function R:lookup($x,$n) {
  let server S implement Server at $x return
  &lt;rr&gt;{   
    from server S return S:RR()/a[@hostname=$n],
    for $ns in (from server S return S:RR()/ns)
    for $a in (from server S return S:RR()/a)

      where $ns/@nameserver=$a/@hostname
      and fn:not($ns/@domain=".")
      and glx:dns-lt($ns/@domain,$n)
      return
      R:lookup($a/@address,$n)/a
  }&lt;/rr&gt;
};
</pre>

In the non-optimized version, the resolver first makes an exec call to get all
the nameserver records, then another one to get all address records and joins
them locally to find out the addresses of servers that could answer its query,
based on the result of the <code>glx:dns-lt()</code> function.
</p> 

</li>

<li><b>Optimized Iterative DNS Resolution</b> <br/>
<!-- R:lookup("192.128.133.77", "www.research.att.com") -->

See the <a href='examples/lookupdxqon/1.html'
target='_blank'>demo</a> and the <a
href='examples/lookupdxqon/anim.gif' target='_blank'>animated
version</a>.

<p>
With DXQ optimizations turned on, the join is pushed inside the exec call
and executed on the server, by rewriting the body of the lookup function 
as below: <!-- corresponds to lookup3() in resolver-opt.xq -->
<pre>
  let server S implement Server at $x return 
  &lt;rr&gt;{
    from server S return S:RR()/a[@hostname=$n],
    for $a in 
      from server S return { 
        for $ns in (from server S return S:RR()/ns),
            $a in (from server S return S:RR()/a)
        where $ns/@nameserver=$a/@hostname
        and fn:not($ns/@domain=".")
        and glx:dns-lt($ns/@domain,$n)
        return $a 
      }
     return
     R:lookup($a/@address,$n)/a
  }&lt;/rr&gt;
</pre>

This reduces the number of requests sent to a server from 3 to 2: one
for the address of the looked-up name and one for the addresses of the
relevant nameservers (which is the result of the join on the server).
For the example in our <a href='examples/lookupdxqon/1.html'
target='_blank'>demo</a>, where the exchange of messages ends after
asking two servers, it means reducing the total number of messages
from 14 to 10.

Please note that in the optimized case, the servers also return tables
of tuples containing the bindings found by the join in the second
argument of the second exec.  In the non-optimized case, exec sends
only path expressions, hence all responses are XML trees.
</p>

</li>

<li><b>Recursive DNS Resolution</b> <br/>

<!-- D:down("www.research.att.com") --> 

See the <a href='examples/recresolution/1.html'
target='_blank'>demo</a> and the <a
href='examples/recresolution/anim.gif' target='_blank'>animated
version</a>.

<p>
The nameservers in our application can also act as nodes in a
<em>peer-to-peer</em> network and perform name resolution by
themselves. In the <a href='examples/recresolution/1.html'
target='_blank'>example</a> we provide, a server is directly ask to
resolve a name which is not in its database, hence it will delegate
the query to another server which is able to answer it, by calling by
calling its <code>S:down()</code> function. As the latter doesn't have
a relevant record, it needs to delegate the request to a third server
which is finally able to answer. The answer is sent back by reversing
the chain of requests.
</p>

</li>

<li><b>DNS Resolution with caching</b>
<br/>

<!-- R:lookup("192.128.133.77", "www.research.att.com") -->

See the <a href='examples/dnswithcache/1.html'
target='_blank'>demo</a> and the <a
href='examples/dnswithcache/anim.gif' target='_blank'>animated
version</a>.

<p>
For reasons of scalability, most DNS implementation do caching at
various levels. In our example, we added a cache on the resolver. The
iterative lookup() is modified to first inspect its local cache and to
stop if it finds an answer there. Otherwise, it proceeds as before,
updating the cache each time a new answer is found. All resource
records contain a <a
href='http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt'>TTL</a> field, representing
the maximum number of seconds that the record can be stored in the
cache. Also, the TTL has to be regularly updated, because it may be
used by other servers along a path of requests, in case they decide to
do caching. In our DXQ program, these specifications are implemented
by <code>do replace</code> and <code>do delete</code> XQuery Update
statements.
</p>

<p>
In our <a
href='examples/dnswithcache/1.html'target='_blank'>demo</a> we first
ran the same lookup as before and we display the exchanged messages. 
Then, we call that lookup again and this time the query is answered
using information from the cache. Thus, event no. 10 (from the first
lookup) and event no. 12 (from the second lookup) give the same address
as answer, but with different TTL's.
</p>


</li>

<li><b>Multicast Simulation</b>
<br/>

<!-- D:multicast("x"); -->

See the <a href='examples/multicast/1.html' target='_blank'>demo</a>
and the <a href='examples/multicast/anim.gif'
target='_blank'>animated version</a>.

<p>
Using an architecture similar to the one from the DNS example, we can
build a multicast service in a peer-to-peer network. The main
ingredients allowing this are a node's capacity to export data and to
delegate queries to other nodes. <br/>

The interface exported by the peers consists in:

<ul>

<li> A <code>deliver()</code> function that processes a request.</li>

<li> A <code>multicast()</code> function that tries to process the
request locally and also delegates it to relevant nodes by calling
asynchronously their own <code>multicast()</code>.</li>

</ul>

Please note that the definitions of <code>deliver()</code> and
<code>multicast()</code> may not be the same on all nodes, giving a
lot of flexibility in the implementation of the protocol.

</p>

</li>
</ol>

<h2>Narada</h2>

<p>
Narada is a mesh overlay network in which nodes can
dynamically enter and leave the mesh overlay and which
provides infrastructure for routing and multicast. Overlay
networks like Narada are interesting test cases for DXQ, because
they require periodic, asynchronous messages to maintain
protocol state, and the state includes membership and
routing tables that can be naturally described and manipulated
in XML. More details are available in the 
<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/49/22260/01038577.pdf">
JSAC paper</a>.
</p>

<p>The core functionality of the protocol is simulated by 3 top-level
functions:

<pre>
interface namespace Narada = "narada";

declare updating function Narada:depart() as empty-sequence() external;
declare updating function Narada:die() as empty-sequence() external;
declare updating function Narada:go() as empty-sequence() external;

</pre>
</p>

<ul>

<li> <code>depart()</code>, as its name suggests,  provokes an explicit departure from the
network.
</li>

<li>Calling <code>die()</code>, on the other hand, makes the node die without any warning
for its peers.</li>

<li>The <code>go()</code> function implements the main functionality by 
updating local state and sending various kinds of messages:
<ul>
<li><i>refresh probe</i>: update local information</li>
<li><i>latency probe</i>: test the latency of a peer</li>
<li><i>neighbor probe</i>: update information regarding neighbors</li>
<li><i>routing probe</i>: send routing table to neighbors</li>
<ul>
</li>

</ul>
