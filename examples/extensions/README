Galax supports several extensions to XQuery 1.0, notably XML updates
and a procedural extensions. Here is a short summary of the supported
extensions:

    * The July 11th 2006 version of the W3C XQuery Update Facility
      (http://www.w3.org/TR/xqupdate/). Note, that this allows updates
      everywhere though :). Usecases for that language can be found in
      the Galax usecases directory.

    * The XQuery! language (http://xquerybang.cs.washington.edu/), in
      which the syntax for atomic updates has been aligned with the
      July 11th 2006 version of the W3C XQuery Update Facility.

    * The XQueryP language
      (http://www.ximep-2006.org/papers/Paper-Chamberlin-Carey.pdf).

Some examples of each of the three languages are provided in the
examples/extensions directory. To run one of those languages, you must
use the corresponding language level option on the command line, as
follows:

  glx xquery -language ultf xquery_updates.xq    (: For the W3C Update Facility :)
  glx xquery -language xquerybang xquery_bang.xq (: For the XQuery! Language :)
  glx xquery -language xqueryp xquery_p.xq       (: For the XQueryP Language :)
