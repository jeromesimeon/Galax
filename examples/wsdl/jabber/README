REQUIREMENTS
============

  1. Jabber 1.4
     See "How to install a Jabber server" below

  2. Gaim Client

     Gaim is installed by default on RedHat
     See "How to configure a GAIM Jabber client"

How to install a Jabber server
==============================

1. General Jabber info at : http://www.jabber.org 

2. Download server from:

   http://jabberd.jabberstudio.org/1.4/

3. You will need the GNU Portable Threads Library to compile Jabber
   server

   Download from:

     http://www.gnu.org/software/pth/

  The PTH library by default is installed in /usr/local/lib.  

4. You will need the Iksemel library, which is used for stub generation.

   This package may or may not be installed by default. 

   If not, download from: 

     http://iksemel.jabberstudio.org/

   Follow installation instructions

   (From Nicola: When you install the Jabber server, this library should be included.)
   (From Mary: I had to download it separately)

5. To install and test Jabber server, follow instructions in:

     http://jabberd.jabberstudio.org/1.4/doc/adminguide

   No need to assign a domain name to this Jabber server -- just use
   default 'localhost ' for demo.


  (From Nicola:
  
   I have jabberd v1.4.3 which comes with the jabber package in the
   Debian unstable distribution. There are also packages for transports
   towards other IM protocols: jabber-msn, jabber-yahoo etc.

   All these packages do not normally require any special
   configuration. The main configuration file is usually stored in
   /etc/jabber/jabber.cfg

   By default, a jabber server listens on port 5222 for normal
   connections and on port 5223 or 5224 for encrypted connections.

   All this options are set in /etc/jabber/jabber.xml Sometimes, the
   configuration for the SSL port is commented: line 418 in my default
   installation.)

6. Run jabberd 

   Make sure path to PTH library is in LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/lib

   Run jabberd

   <path to jabber>/jabberd/jabberd

   Add -D for debug mode
